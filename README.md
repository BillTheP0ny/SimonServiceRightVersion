Simon Service application- I learned alot of really cool things from this simon server project. One of the coolest things I thought was the json file. Its crazy how much code is needed in there to make the application work. When we were doing our smaller projects like node or express I  did not realize that it could turn into a massive project like package-lock.json. I thinks its really cool how thepackage lock json locks the dependencys with the installed version. Its  a great idea to lock the packages becuase the different versions can cause various errors which i never coonsidered. I know that the package lock json is randomly generated but its still really cool. I liked the package.json better becuase it made mre sense and felt more managable after reading thorugh the package lock. I think its cool how you use the different URL tags to access diferent areas of the github.
